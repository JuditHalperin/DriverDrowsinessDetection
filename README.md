# DriverDrowsinessDetection
Artificial Intelligence Project, 2022

A system that can automatically detect a driver drowsiness in a real-time video stream, using computer vision and neural network (deep learning) algorithms.

The classification is based on blinks, yawns, time and travel duration. When the driver appears to be drowsy, the system will play an alarm in the car and send a warning email to an emergency contact.
